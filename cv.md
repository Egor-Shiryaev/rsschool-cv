## About Me

Hello, my goal is to master the knowledge and skills in programming needed to get a job. I have little experience in programming and layout. Now I'm studying a course on JS / FRONT-END from RS School. I consider my strong point to be the ability to work in a team.

## Code examples

```
const well = x => {
  const good_count = x.filter(x => x == 'good').length;
  return good_count < 1 ? 'Fail!' :
         good_count < 3 ? 'Publish!' : 'I smell a series!';
}
```
